# Lab 7
Tasks:Replace the in-memory database in Lab 6 to MongoDB. You can download the server and client code under Lab 7. You can also use your own implementation code in Lab 6.

## What you need to change?
1. Server: you need to change models, controllers, and app.js
2. Client: Using MongoDB, the primary key is "_id" instead of id. So you need to make the change.
