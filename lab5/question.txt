everything from scrtach. Run "npm install" under lesson05-server to get express package installed.
Implement the features below inside lesson05-server REST applicaiton

A book has properties: id, title, ISBN, publishedDate, author
make proper changes in js files to implement the step 1 features
Use Postman to test your REST APIs

Implement the features below inside lesson05-client project. This project acts as SPA which make calls 
to lesson05-server APIs. You must have strong knowledge on JavaScript DOM APIs to complete the tasks. 
I highly recommand you to do this part if you have time.

List all books in index.html when open index.html in browser
